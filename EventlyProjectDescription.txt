Description: 
	Website to list events happening in your city.  

Show “hot spots” in community based on aggregate of event data over time (?)
Allow filtering search by location, event type and other criteria (will depend on API)
Show estimate end times for events and notify ride-share drivers when large events will be ending
Allow targeting to wealthier neighborhoods to determine where riders are most likely to pay surge pricing (per Patrick’s suggestion).  Using zillow API?

	- Populate map with events.  Update events location changes. 
(3) Filtering Live Search Results

	- On click, open a form (modal?) with input boxes for event information
	- On submit, push event data to firebase
